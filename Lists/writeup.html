        <h1>FINDING AID - MICAELA TERRY</h1>

        <h2>Biographical Note</h2>

        <p>Micaela Terry is a 22 year old multimedia artist born and raised in southern California. She grew up in a culturally aware family, born to a Filipino mother and Caucasian father who met in France, married in the Philippines, and moved to
          the United States afterward. Micaela’s interests in animation, narrative storytelling, and more specifically in Japanese anime led to her interest in illustration and graphic design, which in turn led to a broader interest in digital media
          as a whole. On the side, she also dabbles in costume design. Her work draws influences from both her struggles with perfectionism, depression, and anxiety, growing up, as well as media that helped her through these difficulties.</p>

        <h2>Scope and Content Note</h2>

        <p>The work archived here was created from 2018 to 2021, and includes video/film, audio, illustration, web design, motion graphics, costume design, and creative code. Purposes for which the content was made include academics, client work, and
          personal enjoyment. Several themes are apparent in each body of work, but among the most prominent are mental health, self image, and human connection (love, friendship, and family). Several of the works (particularly those done for
          personal enjoyment) are transformative in some way, often depicting characters from favorite media, but these are also included in the archive for the purposes of demonstrating technical skill.</p>

        <p>Notably, the works are also able to be organized by amount of personal enjoyment. This may refer to fulfillment from the project, or personal pleasure or displeasure with the final result. Personal favorite works are given special
          distinction. Notably, older works tend to fall short of the “personal favorite” category, usually because of technical improvements that have been made in the craft since those pieces were made. There are, of course, exceptions to this
          pattern.</p>
