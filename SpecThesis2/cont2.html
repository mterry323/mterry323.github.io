      <p>This was drawn as one of two responses I had to make for my application to Rhode Island School of Art and Design. The prompt was &quot;contain.&quot; I wanted one of my responses to be more literal, and the other to be more figurative. This is the figurative one, viewing the body as a container for different emotions - the different colors. I still like the concept, but I think this piece was hurt by me trying to draw in realism for the sake of seeming like a &quot;real&quot; artist. I didn&rsquo;t end up getting into RISD.</p>
