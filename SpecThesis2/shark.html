      <p>I drew this shark in a cup in my art class senior year of high school. It was meant as an exercise in noticing the distortion water causes, and in using charcoal. I was pretty happy with it at the time, though I think the only reason this was even in my portfolio for college apps was that it was like proof that &quot;hey, I draw studies from life!&quot; It&rsquo;s really the epitome of going through the motions - drawing it because of a class, and submitting it because that&rsquo;s what the art schools want to see. If I could go back and tell my younger self to put things with more emotional significance to me in my portfolio, I would.</p>
