      <p>This is the REALLY old version of a piece I redrew for a college app, in order to show my growth as an illustrator. I was eleven when I drew this. It&rsquo;s fanart for a couple of old songs I really liked at the time, called Daughter / Servant of Evil. As proud as I am of how far I&rsquo;ve come, I love looking back at this thing and laughing at it. Like. Why are their heads shaped like that. Why are their hands smaller than their eyes. <i>Where are their eyebrows.</i></p>
