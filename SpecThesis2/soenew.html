      <p>This is actually a redraw of a <i>really</i> old piece I drew when I was around 11 years old. It&rsquo;s fanart for a series of songs from my childhood, called Daughter / Servant of Evil. They&rsquo;re about a tyrannical princess and a servant that dies for her when the kingdom turns on her. Spoilers I guess.<br><br>I was actually pretty scared to put this in my portfolio for any of my college applications, but I end up putting it on my application to Champlain College in a little town in Vermont. The hope was to show them how much I&rsquo;d improved in seven years. Though I had to pass it off as just &quot;a princess and her servant&quot; without any reference to the songs because I was worried about getting flack for drawing fanart. I ended up getting accepted to Champlain though!</p>
