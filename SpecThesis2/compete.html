      <p>I wrote this poem for an assignment my freshman year of high school. We had to make a work that explores the same themes as <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. Initially I wanted to write a story, but in true student fashion, I procrastinated, so I ended up writing a poem the day before instead. It&rsquo;s actually loosely inspired by the rivalry between Red and Blue, from the first <i>Pokemon</i> games, because that was what I was really into at the time. But in my defense, it was a good lens to write more generally about destructive rivalry with. And hey, I got a good grade.</p><p>I still liked this poem senior year, so I made it into a graphic to show to the Champlain College admissions people. The purple hydrangeas in the background represent a desire to know someone deeply. Ignore my horrible typesetting.</p>
