notes:
More research in art therapy

-randomize order of images
-randomize design of site (fonts, colors, etc)
-make it more like a desk and less like a grid (things overlapping, etc)
-make thumbnails draggable
   -maybe stack them all at first and make it so you HAVE to drag them
-description is too long sideways (feels like multiple paragraphs); make it more square shaped
-make the vignettes/text blurbs ALSO draggable "papers"
-photos of physical environment you were working in
