      <p>This is the more literal half of two responses to the prompt &quot;contain&quot; for my RISD application. The other was more metaphorical. This one was meant to literally contain things that I felt represented me. I just put things I like in a shoebox and took a picture of it. I did do some Photoshop to bring out the colors and make things stand out, but I, in my <i>infinite wisdom,</i> deleted the retouched photo because I ended up not liking this piece as a whole as time went on. I guess that&rsquo;s also indicative of the stress I was under to make things at the time.</p>
