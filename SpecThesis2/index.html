    <h1>The College Application Era</h1>
    <p>Here are a bunch of works from the same point of time in my life: during senior year of high school, during college application time. I have a lot of mixed feelings about a lot of these (and <i>had</i> a lot of mixed feelings at the time I
      made them). Looking back, a lot of these have to do with trying to be seen as a "real" artist (the definition of that seemed to be "artist who draws realism"). Looking back on these now, I think I've realized that's not what I enjoy. Life
      drawing is important, of course â€” but that's different from <i>realism</i> as an art style.</p>

    <!-- This is actually a redraw of a <i>really</i> old piece I drew when I was around 11 years old. It&rsquo;s fanart for a series of songs from my childhood, called Daughter / Servant of Evil. They&rsquo;re about a tyrannical princess and a servant that dies for her when the kingdom turns on her. Spoilers I guess.<br><br>I was actually pretty scared to put this in my portfolio for any of my college applications, but I end up putting it on my application to Champlain College in a little town in Vermont. The hope was to show them how much I&rsquo;d improved in seven years. Though I had to pass it off as just &quot;a princess and her servant&quot; without any reference to the songs because I was worried about getting flack for drawing fanart. I ended up getting accepted to Champlain though! -->
