      <p>This was the graphic I made when applying to Media Arts + Practice, which is meant to represent my personal struggles in transitioning to adulthood. This was born in a time of stress and uncertainty in my life. College was fast approaching,
        which meant finishing high school with good grades, meeting application deadlines, graduating, moving away from family. This wasn&rsquo;t just a part of my application. It was an outlet for all of the pressure put on me by school, family,
        society, and myself.<br><br>Looking back at this graphic now, although I&rsquo;d make some cosmetic changes (like using an actual photo of myself instead of stock photos), it still hits really hard. Though it&rsquo;s a good reminder of my
        ability to use my craft as my diary and my therapist.</p>
