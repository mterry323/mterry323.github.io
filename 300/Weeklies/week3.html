<p><b>What is the relationship of speed or velocity and digital images?</b></p>

<p>Digital images lose resolution as they gain speed. The "poor image" described by Steyerl has lost fidelity as a result of being compressed over and over again and sent to different people multiple times. While the high resolution image is considered more visually pleasing, desirable, or technically superior, the poor image circulated because of the desire of many people to spread it around, so its loss of resolution actually speaks to the value of the content of the digital image. Steyrel calls poor images "travelers" in the digital space, and what the poor image lacks in fidelity, it makes up for in its ability to be spread quickly across the Internet.</p>
