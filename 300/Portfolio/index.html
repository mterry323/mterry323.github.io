    <h1>hey my dudes, my name's micaela.</h1>
    <p> I'm 20, and my pronouns are she/her. I'm mixed Filipino and caucasian, I was born and raised in San Diego, and I enjoy music, drawing, pop culture, and digital media in general. In fact, I like media so much that I decided to go into a program that lets me do ★ all the media! ★</p>

    <p>I'm currently a student of Media Arts + Practice at the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts. My work aims to explore themes such as mental illness and social justice through various digital mediums. I hope to employ my own, deeply personal experiences as a vehicle to teach my audience that, in a world which is tired, jaded, and heavily divided, it pays to have empathy for others that aren't like you.</p>

    <p>Outside of my work as a digital studies student, I'm also studying Japanese, and I have been a hobbyist illustrator for about eleven years. My work is also informed by the technical skills and social and cultural lessons I've learned through exploring these areas of discourse throughout my life.</p>
