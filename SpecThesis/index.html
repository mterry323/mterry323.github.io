It&rsquo;s fanart for a series of songs from my childhood, called Daughter / Servant of Evil. They&rsquo;re about a tyrannical princess and a servant that dies for her when the kingdom turns on her. Spoilers I guess.<br><br>I was actually pretty scared to put this in my portfolio for any of my college applications, but I end up putting it on my application to Champlain College in a little town in Vermont. The hope was to show them how much I&rsquo;d improved in seven years. Though I had to pass it off as just &quot;a princess and her servant&quot; without any reference to the songs because I was worried about getting flack for drawing fanart. I ended up getting accepted to Champlain though!');">

The prompt was &quot;contain.&quot; I wanted one of my responses to be more literal, and the other to be more figurative. This is the figurative one, viewing the body as a container for different emotions - the different colors. I still like the concept, but I think this piece was hurt by me trying to draw in realism for the sake of seeming like a &quot;real&quot; artist. I didn&rsquo;t end up getting into RISD.');">

As proud as I am of how far I&rsquo;ve come, I love looking back at this thing and laughing at it. Like. Why are their heads shaped like that.
