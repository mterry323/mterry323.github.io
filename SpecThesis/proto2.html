    <h1>The College Application Era</h1>
    <p>Here are a bunch of works from the same point of time in my life: during senior year of high school, during college application time. I have a lot of mixed feelings about a lot of these (and <i>had</i> a lot of mixed feelings at the time I
        made them). Looking back, a lot of these have to do with trying to be seen as a "real" artist (the definition of that seemed to be "artist who draws realism"). Looking back on these now, I think I've realized that's not what I enjoy. Life
        drawing is important, of course â€” but that's different from <i>realism</i> as an art style.</p>

Spoilers I guess.<br><br>I was actually pretty scared to put this in my portfolio for any of my college applications, but I end up putting it on my application to Champlain College in a little town in Vermont. The hope was to show them how much I&rsquo;d improved in seven years. Though I had to pass it off as just &quot;a princess and her servant&quot; without any reference to the songs because I was worried about getting flack for drawing fanart. I ended up getting accepted to Champlain though!');">

This is the figurative one, viewing the body as a container for different emotions - the different colors. I still like the concept, but I think this piece was hurt by me trying to draw in realism for the sake of seeming like a &quot;real&quot; artist. I didn&rsquo;t end up getting into RISD.');">

It&rsquo;s actually loosely inspired by the rivalry between Red and Blue, from the first <i>Pokemon</i> games, because that was what I was really into at the time. But in my defense, it was a good lens to write more generally about destructive rivalry with. And hey, I got a good grade.<br><br>I still liked this poem senior year, so I made it into a graphic to show to the Champlain College admissions people.
