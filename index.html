<h1>Hello everyone there is a very good explanation as to why this page has no CSS styling right now</h1>
<p>It is that I have only one brain cell. See, we downloaded GitHub for desktop, and then my stupid self totally forgot about it until seeing other people's GitHub directories for their weeklies. And that was when I realized people were hosting their weeklies online. For the web design class. Makes sense, right? Not to my one singular brain cell. I have been emailing my weeklies to Eric and Remi for this entire semester. So, you see, this page is a very hastily thrown together directory of all of the weeklies I've done so far which I'll style and make pretty when it's not 8:53 PM on a Wednesday night with homework for multiple classes awaiting my attention. Thank you for your understanding you lovely genderless individual I hope you have a swell day and can forgive how ugly this page is until further notice</p>
