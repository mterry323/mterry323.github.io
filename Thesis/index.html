      <p>A portfolio is curated. The person making the portfolio puts their best foot forward, only selecting their finest works that they feel are appropriate for the context that the portfolio will be viewed in. But with such a curated, tidy
        selection of work, the process is often lost. Not everything that a creator considers “portfolio-worthy” reflects the entirety of who an artist is as a person.</p>
      <p>This is what The Rest of the Portfolio seeks to represent. This project is a web-based selection of works in progress, unfinished works, practice sketches, and derivative works that would not be featured on a traditional portfolio. By
        putting
        on the headphones next to each individual piece that you find in this gallery, you will hear some of the thoughts associated with that piece, rising up above a sea of thoughts about the rest of my work.</p>
