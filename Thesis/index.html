      <p>A portfolio is curated. The person making the portfolio puts their best foot forward, only selecting their finest works that they feel are appropriate for the context that the portfolio will be viewed in. But art is an imperfect process, in the same way that humans are imperfect beings. An artist often struggles—be it with the physical act of making, the journey to “perfecting” their craft, or with the emotions associated with a given piece. Creation is not a linear journey, either; sometimes an artist stagnates or deals with creative blocks. Therefore, it is important to have a more holistic representation of an artist’s work, and by extension, who they are as a person.</p>
      <p>This is what this project attempts to represent.</p>

    <h1>About This Project</h1>
    <p>A portfolio is curated. The person making the portfolio puts their best foot forward, only selecting their finest works that they feel are appropriate for the context that the portfolio will be viewed in. But art is an imperfect process, in the same way that humans are imperfect beings. An artist often struggles—be it with the physical act of making, the journey to “perfecting” their craft, or with the emotions associated with a given piece. Creation is not a linear journey, either; sometimes an artist stagnates or deals with creative blocks. Therefore, it is important to have a more holistic representation of an artist’s work, and by extension, who they are as a person; this is what my project attempts to represent.</p>
    <p><i>The Rest of the Portfolio</i> is a web-based selection of my own works in progress, unfinished works, ideas, practice sketches, and derivative works that would not typically be considered portfolio-worthy. Opening each individual work will allow you to hear some of the thoughts associated with that piece, rising up above a sea of thoughts about the rest of my work.</p>
    <p>Alt text is available for those who need it, but I would encourage those who do not need it to experience this piece with alt text off and background voices on for the full effect.</p>

      <p>Okay, I can't pinpoint what exactly is wrong with this first attempt, but it is NOT working.</p>
